# Tooling integration - SmartBear API Platform

In this guide, you'll learn how to use the SmartBear API Platform, to add improve confidence and add visibility to your design first API development workflow.

- [PactFlow](https://PactFlow.io/)
- [SwaggerHub](https://swaggerhub.com/)
- [ReadyAPI](https://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/)
- [SwaggerHub Explore](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub-explore/)

## Benefits

SmartBear's API Platform tools can be combined to increase the quality of your design-first API development workflow, and help navigate the complexity of microservices rollout.

SwaggerHub is foundation of a repeatable process for API Development, providing a secure collaborative environment for your API design process:

1. It unifies teams around a single source of truth - **the OAS** - and enables standardisation across your services
1. Allows teams to work **independently**
2. **Unlocks automation** such as code-generation and mock services

PactFlow brings increased visibility into how consumers use your API, enabling:

1. API consumer and API producer development teams to work in independently and **safely**
2. **Prevent breaking changes** to your API and releasing an incompatible API consumer
3. A reduction in the need for **API versioning**, avoiding the need to create and maintain multiple versions of an API, and communicating the change to consumers.


<!-- ReadyAPI brings:

2. TODO
3. TODO

SwaggerHub Explore brings:

Together, they allow faster feedback cycles from design through to development, test and release.

## _Pre-requisites:_

To use this feature, you will need:

* A [PactFlow](https://PactFlow.io) account (create a [free account](https://PactFlow.io/pricing/)).
* A [SwaggerHub](https://swaggerhub.com) account (create a [free account](https://try.smartbear.com/)).
  * For the [SwaggerHub/PactFlow integration](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/integrations/PactFlow/), you will need a team /enterprise account, to create private API's, or you can use the integration for the first 14 day trial of enterprise.
* A [ReadyAPI](https://swaggerhub.com) account (create a [free 14 day trial account](https://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/free-trial)).

## The FinTech Scenario

![SmartBearCoin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19932401/224381085-3e54afaf-919b-4c49-8921-0b3b829bf692.png)

Our company _SmartBearCoin_ is expanding to offer services across the wider European region and thus our Payments Domain (business capability) are extending our payment processing sub-capability to cater for cross border payments. 

**The Business Requirements**

The Payments capability has requested the following from Customer Management capability:

>The ability to be able to retrieve customer information to help them have up-to-date and accurate payee information at the point to issuing a cross border payment. It was also mentioned was the need to obtain payment transaction summary information for payees but the ask was not very clear ðŸ˜•



## Overview

- Establish the business requirements and set the scene â€‹
- Enforce API design standards to meet regulatory requirements â€‹
- Use SwaggerHub to unlock the advantages of the design-first approach for APIsâ€‹
- Use ReadyAPI for integrated API testing (functional/security/perf)â€‹
- Use ReadyAPI setup rich API virtualization â€‹
- Use PactFlow Implement bi-directional API contract testing â€‹
- Leverage API definitions and artifacts for DevOps automationâ€‹
- Run through provider and client deployments with quality-gated CI/CD flowsâ€‹
- Demonstrate how we can safely catch breaking changesâ€‹

## Integration Guide

### Requirements & Design

1. TODO

###Â Development, Testing & Virtualisation - Provider

1. Import OpenAPI from SwaggerHub to ReadyAPI
2. Create ReadyAPI Functional Tests
3. Test ReadyAPI tests against virt-server locally
4. Test ReadyAPI tests against virt-server locally with test runner
5. Test ReadyAPI tests against virt-server locally with test runner docker
6. Test ReadyAPI tests against virt-server in CI
7. Upload to Provider Contract to PactFlow


###Â Coding & Deployment - Provider


Here we implement the API (as per design) by manually creating an Azure Function using .NET 6.0. To speed up the creation and to ensure we conform with the schemas, we'll use SwaggerHub code generation capabilities.

![Provider Code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19932401/224380794-2e6aa347-d3a0-4510-9a00-1544c71180b5.png)

1. In SwaggerHub export a _server stub_ from the OpenAPI definition (_Export > Server Stub > aspnetcore_)
2. Extract the models into the _Models > OpenAPI_ folder of the `provider_azure_function` solution
3. Ensure all paths defined in the OpenAPI definition are implemented by an Azure Function controller
4. Build out the appropriate validation services as required
5. Ensure all required infrastructure is contained in the Azure Resource Manager template (`azuredeploy.json`)
6. Build and commit the project

![Provider Flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19932401/224380790-9ccbf134-a49e-4a0c-af54-31ebb1ed86b7.png)

7. Kick off the `Provider-API-AzureFunction-CI` GitHub action which covers the following:
    - checks out and builds
    - tests using ReadyAPI project created above
    - deploys infra to azure
    - adds provider contract to PactFlow leveraging the `can-i-deploy` check


If you want to run and edit the provider locally, then take note of the following:

#### Prerequisites
- VSCode, Visual Studio or other IDE capable of running .NET 6 projects
- .NET 6
- ngrok

The project was created using VSCode with the following extensions installed:
- [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)
- [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)


Ensure that your development certs are trusted (required for debugging)
```
dotnet dev-certs  https --trust
```
#### Running locally

Clone the repo and ensure the project builds
```
dotnet build
```
Setup your `local.settings.json` file. Here is a sample settings configuration:
```
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet"
  },
  "Host": {
    "CORS": "*"
  }
}
```
