# Edit OpenAPI Document in SwaggerHub
# Sync OpenAPI -> SCM with Github Sync - https://support.smartbear.com/swaggerhub/docs/integrations/github-sync.html
# Version number = OpenAPI SemVer Version + GitHub Commit Sha for traceability on change
# OpenAPI + Provider Test Report = Provider Contract Uploaded to Pactflow
# *** Test Report is just OAS file, as the design will not be tested against an API mock or real implementation at this stage ***
# Pactflow compares OpenAPI against any registered consumers
# Visiblity into affected consumers visible via can-i-deploy
